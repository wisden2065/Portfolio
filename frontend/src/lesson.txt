in the scr file, we have the assets folder that includes all the assets that we want react to optimize

in the public folder we include the assets that we do not want react to optimize - static assets


VITE 
- uses HMR- Hot Module Replacement over native esm (Ecma Script Module)
  Meaning that instead of bundling the entire code to server it up to the browser, vite just replaces the part of the code that just got changed
  making vite to achieve fast dev server start up time during scaffolding, 
  and fast updates while the dev server is still running (without blowing uo the application state) 


  when we run npm run build:
     - any assets like images put in assets folder in src would be optimized by react 
       either by hashing it...since the file is greater than say 4kb ---we can see a hash appended to the asset/img name - then stored in the dist folder
        ::hence any file in the directory is imported by its relative path


            like  import sophos from '../../assets/icons/sophos.png'


    - if the asset is in the public folder it would not be optimized, i.e it would be coped as it is
         ::hence any file in the directory is imported by its absolute  path



            like import CyberSecurity from '/images/courses/cyber-security.jpg'
